Assuming that your current directory is one containing this file use following
commands to compile program (prefix is /usr/ since /usr/local/ may work
incorrect):

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/ ..
make

And to install it run:

su -c "make install"

To configure do:

cp mpdknotifierrc-sample ~/.kde/share/config/mpdknotifierrc

And edit it. See README file for available options.
