2. Description

This small program shows notifications with short information about current
track of MPD using libnotify (http://www.galago-project.org/news/index.php). It
can:
- display album art
- use external application to get cover (format is supported)
- resize album art if its bigger than needed
- display custom list of commands (format is supported)

3. Options in mpdknotifierrc file

In configuration file mpdknotifierrc (that should be copied into
~/.kde/share/config/) in group "General" you can use options from the list
below:
1. MPDHost
2. MPDPort
3. MusicDir
4. CommandsNames
5. Commands
6. Format
7. ArtFindCmd
8. LogFile
9. PreferredCoverWidth
10. PreferredCoverHeight
11. ArtResizeCmd

Note: 
There is a default value for each option. So you can skip some of theme in your
configuration file. You can see them below in brackets after equals ('=')
symbol. Here is full format of each entry:
    n) parameter_name [=default_value]
    Description.

1) MPDHost [=localhost]
Sets IP address or DNS name of MPD server host.

2) MPDPort [=6600]
Sets number of port to connect to MPD server.

3) MusicDir [=/mnt/music/]
Sets path to the music collection, should be same as one in mpd.conf. Needed for
getting album art.

4) CommandsNames [=Open ncmpcpp]
List of semicolon (';') separated command names.

5) Commands [=terminal -x ncmpcpp]
List of semicolon (';') commands. Next special sequences can be used:
- '%a' - full path to album art
- '%f' - full path to current track
- '%d' - full path to parent directory of current track
- '%с' - name of album art file
- '%%' - percent symbol

6) Format [=%Artist% - %Title%{\n%Album%} {(%Date%)}]
Format string for text message in the notification. You can use any tags that
are supported by your version of MPD server. Just surround them with percent
('%') symbol.
Also you can use conditional blocks using curly brackets ('{' and '}').
Conditional block will be displayed only if all tags it includes had been
expanded. For additional formating HTML tags (<b></b>, <i></i>, <br>, ...) and
escape sequences ('\t', '\n', ...) can be used. But depending on your notify
daemon you can use both types together or only one at a time.

7) ArtFindCmd [=<empty string>]
If MPDKNotifier can't find album art, then this command is executed and search
is repeated.

8) LogFile [=~/.mpdknotifier/log.txt]
Log file name. You can use '~' symbol to refer to your home directory. 

9) PreferredCoverWidth [=200]
Preferred width of album art in pixels. This option is used for scaling album
art and to decide if we need to call ArtResizeCmd.

10) PreferredCoverHeight [=200]
Preferred height of album art in pixels. This option is also used for scaling
album art and to decide if we need to call ArtResizeCmd.

11) ArtResizeCmd [=<empty string>]
Contains command for resizing images bigger than PreferredCoverWidth x
PreferredCoverHeight. You can use all special sequences like in Commands option.

4. Album art search algorithm

Firstly a search for any jpg, png or gif file in parent directory of current
track is performed. If we found nothing than executing command from ArtFindCmd
option and repeating this algorithm from start (but only once). If we found only
1 image, then use it as a cover. Otherwise try to find best match. Perform the
second search using next patterns:
    [fF]ront.jpg
    [fF]ront.png
    [cC]over.jpg
    [cC]over.png
if we have matches take first of them and finish. Else perform third search with
this patterns:
    *[fF]ront*.jpg
    *[fF]ront*.png
    *[cC]over*.jpg
    *[cC]over*.png
if we found something take any of results and finish. Else take first image from
results of first search.
